 <h2>About Oopzy Mail </h2>

Other day i got tired of giving up my email out, just to receive more spam.

Sure you say, get a single use email or free google box for junk mail.
I completely agree there are plenty "All ON" or "All OFF" solutions. However,

<h3> I want </h3>
To give my "public" email out and receive it to my "private" email .
<h3> Yet </h3>
If my email get sold later on, spam will stop at my public email once for all..
